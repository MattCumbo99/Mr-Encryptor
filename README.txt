    Create an exe and a DLL that receives 2 parameters:
        INVALUE as a string
        INOP as a string (possible values: 1= encrypt, 2= decrypt)
    Return the result values.
    The program will use:
        AES256 Encryption
        Encryption Key “MChaffee@HTPD162”
        Create the program using c++ or java.  (make sure you provide the release level)
    Once completed provide:
        Executable objects (exe and DLL- this will be tested to make sure it works)
        Source Code (this is needed to evaluate logic and best practices- you will be provided with a feedback)
        A sample demo (this is the values you have used to test your exe and DLL)
